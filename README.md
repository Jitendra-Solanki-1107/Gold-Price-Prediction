# Gold-Price-Prediction
## Building A Gold Price Prediction Model Using Machine Learning using Random Forest Algorithm

plotting values of actual prices, versus the predicted prices to know, how close ou predictions were to the actual prices :

Thus we can observe, that the actual prices and the predicted prices are almost the same, as the two graphs overlap each other. Thus our model has performed extremely well.

## Conclusion : 

As you saw in this project, we first train a machine learning model, then use the trained model for prediction. Similarly, any model can be made much more precise, by feeding a very large dataset, to get a very accurate score (but it will be pretty time-consuming). For a beginner, I feel the dataset that I had used was pretty decent.
